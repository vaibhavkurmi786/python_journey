# this is a single line comment

"""This is a multi line comment
 now i can write anything
in any number of lines
that i need to because this way i dont have to
use # again and again to comment
each and every line in a single go


"""

# by the way the python does not support multi line comments the above that we wrote is a docstring

# name variable with value as vaibhav
name = "vaibhav"

# age variable with value as 20
age = 20


# important points to remember while creating variables

# 1 can not use number at the start while creating a variable name (but can be used at the last)
# 2 can not use space at the starting or in between while creating a variable name (but can be used at the last as its not counted by python because its ignored at the execution time)
# 3 can not use special characters at the starting or in between while creating a variable


# naming convention 

# there are 3 ways to name a variable 
# 1) Camel Case = pythonLanguage
# 2) Pascal Case = Python Language
# 3) Snake Case = python_language
