# this is a single line comment

"""This is a multi line comment
 now i can write anything
in any number of lines
that i need to because this way i dont have to
use # again and again to comment
each and every line in a single go


"""

# by the way the python does not support multi line comments the above that we wrote is a docstring

# name variable with value as vaibhav
name = "vaibhav"

# age variable with value as 20
age = 20


# important points to remember while creating variables

# 1 can not use number at the start while creating a variable name (but can be used at the last)
# 2 can not use space at the starting or in between while creating a variable name (but can be used at the last as its not counted by python because its ignored at the execution time)
# 3 can not use special characters at the starting or in between while creating a variable


# NAMING CONVENTION 

# there are 3 ways to name a variable 
# 1) Camel Case = pythonLanguage
# 2) Pascal Case = Python Language
# 3) Snake Case = python_language 

# DATATYPES
# 1) NUMBERS
# 1.A) INT  => any number from -infinity to +infinity that doesn't contain a decimal is an integer value (ex)=> 786
# 1.B) FLOAT => any number that has a decimal in it ofr can be written in p/q format is a float value  (ex)=> 2.0
# 1.C) COMPLEX => any number written with j at its last is a complex value (ex)=> 2j

# 2) STRINGS  => anything that is written between "" or '' is called a string (ex)=> 'vaibhav', "kurmi
# 3) BOOLEAN  => True or False (ex)=> b = True, f= False


# in strings if we want to know the unicode of any character we use the method (ord) and to convert any number to character use use the method (chr) (ex)=> ord('a')

print(ord('a'))
print(chr(121))
